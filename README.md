##LEVEL2--LEVEL4

Firstly I wanted to create a react app for my project, since world sensing uses react framework for their pages I wanted to use it too. I also used styled components library. It is useful source for UI. I had trouble where page icons, header icons implemented.
I do not know why I could not do it but I wasted most of my time just to do this UI. After a while I gave up and used fontawesome library and google font library.

I also didn't understand the logic of Frames (from figma) and due to my current internship project I could not implement Responsive Layout but I tried my best to do this UI.

Then I created a form component when we click on the add button and closes when we click 'save' or 'cancel'. Also in these parts I used styled components.

I believe I could have done things more creative and responsive too but I had not enough time for me to do this assignment due to my other responsibilities (there are assignments related with reactjs) for my current company(JotForm). I am really sorry for that.
